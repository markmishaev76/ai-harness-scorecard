# Design Documents

This directory holds design documents for significant changes to the scorecard.

## When to Write a Design Doc

Create a design doc before implementation when:

- Adding a new scoring category
- Changing the scoring algorithm or grade thresholds
- Adding platform API integration (GitHub, GitLab)
- Modifying the data model (`Assessment`, `CheckResult`, etc.)
- Any change that affects how scores are calculated

## Template

```markdown
# Design: <title>

## Problem
What problem are we solving?

## Proposal
How do we solve it?

## Alternatives Considered
What other approaches were evaluated?

## Impact
How does this affect existing scores?
```
